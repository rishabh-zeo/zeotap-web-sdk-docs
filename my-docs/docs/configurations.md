# SDK Configuration Flags

The Zeotap Web SDK can be configured by passing an options object during the `init` call. Below is a comprehensive list of available configuration flags:

| Flag Name                          | Type                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                              | Example Link / Section                                   |
