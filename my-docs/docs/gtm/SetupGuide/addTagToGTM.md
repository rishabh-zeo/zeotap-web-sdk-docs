# Step 2: Adding the Zeotap Collect Tag

Once you have successfully added the Zeotap Collect Tag Template to your Google Tag Manager (GTM) workspace (either from the gallery or by importing the `.tpl` file), the next step is to add the actual tag that will use this template.

Follow these steps to add the Zeotap Collect Tag:

1.  **Navigate to Tags**:
    -   Log into your GTM account.
    -   From the left-hand navigation menu in your GTM workspace, click on **Tags**.

2.  **Create a New Tag**:
    -   Click the **New** button to create a new tag.
    -   Give your tag a descriptive name. For example, "Zeotap Collect" or "Zeotap Main Tag".

3.  **Add the Tag**:
    -   Click on the **Tag Configuration** block to choose a tag type.
    -   A panel will slide out from the right. In the "Choose tag type" search bar, or by scrolling, find the **Zeotap Collect Tag Template** that you added previously.
        -   **Important**: The Zeotap Collect Tag Template will be listed under the **Custom** section.
