# 6. Validate the Configured Collect Tag

Once you have added, configured, and assigned a trigger to the Zeotap Collect Tag, it is important to validate that everything is working as expected. Google Tag Manager provides a built-in **Preview Mode** which allows you to test your tags in a live environment without publishing changes.

Follow the steps below to validate the tag setup.

## Step-by-Step Validation Guide

### 1. Navigate to the Tags Section

### 2. Enable Preview Mode

- In the top-right corner of GTM, click the **Preview** button.
- This will launch the **Tag Assistant** tool in a new tab.

### 3. Enter Website URL

- In the **Tag Assistant** interface, enter the URL of the website where GTM is installed.
- Click **Start** to begin the preview session.

### 4. Interact With Your Website

- Once the Tag Assistant redirects you to your website, perform the actions that would trigger the Zeotap Collect Tag.
  - Example: Navigate to different pages, perform a login, or trigger any configured custom events.

### 5. Inspect Data in Developer Tools

- Right-click on the website and choose **Inspect** to open **Chrome DevTools**.
- Navigate to the **Console** tab.
- Look for the `dataLayer` output and check if the relevant event names (e.g., `Login event`) are logged.

### 6. Review Tag Firing in Tag Assistant

- Return to the **Tag Assistant** tab.
- Click **Continue** to proceed to the next event.
- Under the **Tags Fired** section, verify that the **Zeotap Collect Tag** appears as fired.

## Summary

By completing these steps, you can confirm:

- The tag is active and configured correctly.
- It fires only for the intended events.
- Event data is being pushed to the `dataLayer`.

This process helps ensure that the Zeotap Collect Tag is functioning properly before publishing your GTM container changes to production.
